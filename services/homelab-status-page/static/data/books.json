                        "A representation of thought captures some aspect of a concept or phenomenon in a human-understandable form, thereby enabling a person to perceive and think about it. For example, a piece of music can be represented as a verbal description or as a page of music notation (symbolic); a waveform plot or spectrograph (visual); an audio recording or click track (aural), the pattern of finger movements while playing the piano (tangible), or the experience of walking around an orchestra (spatial).",

                        "Historical examples include Arabic numerals, algebraic notation, data plots, and the periodic table.",
                        "Each new representation enabled subsequent scientific breakthroughs.",
                        "The dynamic medium hosts artifacts that are computational, responsive, and connected.",

                        "Before the 14th century, multiplication was considered a highly abstract concept, only for the mathematical elite. Once place-value Arabic numerals replaced Roman numerals, multiplication and division became mundane. It was this representation which made universal arithmetic literacy possible.",
                         "The dynamic medium hosts artifacts that are computational (capable of simulation), responsive (stimuli determine behavior), and connected (can exchange information with other such artifacts). Dynamic material is the 'stuff' that an author creates in the dynamic medium, to communicate to a reader. Today, this might be called 'software', but the distinction between software, hardware, wetware, etc will break down soon. More importantly, the focus is on human communication — modeling and understanding a concept — not the engineering of a system."
